**[INSERT FIGURE 4.3 HERE]**

**Figure 4.3**: Confusion Matrix for Semiconductor Wafer Defect Classification (Absolute Counts). The matrix displays the classification results on the test set (150 samples) showing true labels on the y-axis and predicted labels on the x-axis. Diagonal elements represent correct classifications, while off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications. The color intensity corresponds to the number of predictions, with darker blue indicating higher counts. Strong diagonal performance demonstrates effective class separation, with notable accuracy in geometric defect patterns (Center, Donut, Edge-Ring) and some confusion between similar defect types (Random vs. Loc). The matrix validates the model's 77.33% overall test accuracy.

**[INSERT FIGURE 4.4 HERE]**

**Figure 4.4**: Normalized Confusion Matrix for Semiconductor Wafer Defect Classification (Classification Accuracy). This normalized version of the confusion matrix displays per-class precision values ranging from 0 to 1, where each row sums to 1.0. The normalization reveals the true positive rate for each defect class, highlighting the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between different defect types. Darker blue regions along the diagonal indicate higher classification accuracy for each class. The matrix shows excellent performance for Near-full (0.875), Edge-Loc (0.882), and Center (0.824) defects, while revealing challenges in classifying Random (0.688) and Loc (0.706) defects due to their inherently variable patterns.

**Strengths:**

- Strong diagonal performance indicating good class separation
- Minimal misclassification between structurally different defect types
- Excellent performance on geometric patterns (Center, Donut, Edge-Ring)
